Day Planner

Day Planner is a sleek, web-based scheduling tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users plan their day hour by hour. It features time blocks for standard work hours (6 AM to 10 PM), color-coded for past, present, and future, with editable task fields and save buttons that store data in localStorage so plans persist across sessions. The interface is responsive and user-friendly, displaying the current date using javascript to enhance the overall experience.
